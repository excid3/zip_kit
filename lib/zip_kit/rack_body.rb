# RackBody is actually just another use of the OutputEnumerator, since a Rack body
# object must support `#each` yielding successive binary strings.
#
# The RackBody can also wrap itself in a chunking wrapper. This is for outputting
# a ZIP archive from Rails or Rack, where an object responding to `each` is required
# which yields Strings. You can return a ZIP archive from Rack like so:
#
#     iterable_zip_body = ZipKit::RackBody.new do | streamer |
#       streamer.write_file('big.csv') do |sink|
#         CSV(sink) do |csv_writer|
#           csv_writer << Person.column_names
#           Person.all.find_each do |person|
#             csv_writer << person.attributes.values
#           end
#         end
#       end
#     end
#
# Either as a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` response (if your webserver supports it),
# which will give you true streaming capability:
#
#     chunked_body = iterable_zip_body.to_chunked
#     headers = {
#       "Last-Modified" => Time.now.httpdate, # disables Rack::ETag
#       "Content-Type" => "application/zip",
#       "Content-Disposition" => "attachment",
#       "Transfer-Encoding" => "chunked",
#       "X-Accel-Buffering" => "no" # disables buffering in nginx/GCP
#     }
#     [200, headers, chunked_body]
#
# or in a `TempfileBody` object which buffers the ZIP before output. Buffering has
# benefits if your webserver does not support anything beyound HTTP/1.0:
#
#     tf_body = iterable_zip_body.to_tempfile_body
#     headers = {
#       "Last-Modified" => Time.now.httpdate, # disables Rack::ETag
#       "Content-Type" => "application/zip",
#       "Content-Disposition" => "attachment",
#       "Content-Length" => tf_body.content_length,
#     }
#     [200, headers, tf_body]

  # A body wrapper that emits chunked responses, creating valid

  # Rails has a substitute class for this inside ActionController::Streaming,
  # but that module is a private constant in the Rails codebase, and is thus
  # considered "private" from the Rails standpoint. It is not that much code to
